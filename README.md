# gandalf

Gandalf is a proof assistant written in Rust based on the LF logical framework, an extension of the simply typed lambda calculus with dependent types. In LF, an object logic must be encoded in an LF signature. Syntax is embedded as LF types and term constructors. Judgments in the object logic are also represented as dependent LF types.
